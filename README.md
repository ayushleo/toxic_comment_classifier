# 🧾 Toxic Comment Classification

A machine learning project to detect and classify toxic comments using NLP techniques.

✅ Project Overview

This project builds a model that identifies whether a given comment is toxic or non-toxic. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify text based on patterns in language.

This can be used for:

Social media moderation

Community forums

Automated filtering systems

Chat applications

📌 Dataset

The dataset typically contains text comments with corresponding labels such as:

Column	Description
comment_text	Raw user comment
toxic	1 = toxic, 0 = non-toxic

(Adjust based on your actual dataset—multi-label like obscene, threat, insult, etc., if applicable.)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

nltk / spaCy

matplotlib / seaborn

tensorflow / keras (if deep learning is used)

(Add/remove libraries based on your notebook.)

🔄 Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Text cleaning

Stopword removal

Lemmatization/stemming

Tokenization

Vectorization (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, or embeddings)

2️⃣ Model Training

Models may include:

Logistic Regression

SVM

Random Forest

Naive Bayes

LSTM/GRU/BERT models (if deep learning)

3️⃣ Evaluation

Common metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion matrix

ROC-AUC (if binary classification)

4️⃣ Prediction

The final model predicts whether an input comment is toxic or not.
